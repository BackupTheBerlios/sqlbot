About
-=-=-
Sqlbot is a full-featured perl bot for opendchub, designed around MySQL. All of its
functions are parsed to and from MySQL, making it configurable on_the_fly via a
webserver, and hopefully some time in the near future partally configurable via
the bot itself.

Why MySQL? Well, others had started in this field using MySQL purely for logging
purposes, which is what we started with, but soon realised that MySQL could do a
heck-of-a-lot more. We both came up with a simple idea to actually have almost all
hard-coded data in MySQL (like client rules, options, logging and so on), making it
possible to allow remote hub configuration via a web interface, this was a big bonus
for the hub allowing the hub owner to montior the  hub remotly, and check on whats
happening. A big plus for hub owners who have to leave the hub unattended while
doing normal daily things.



Requirements (external)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
opendchub => 0.7.10	http://opendchub.sourceforge.net/
apache			With php module support (most distros have this)
php-mysql		Module for Apache to connect and use MySQL (most distros have this)
MySQL server		Running with a configured user
DBI::MySql            	(Included with all distros)
IP::Country::Fast     	http://nutter.kicks-ass.net:35600/software/odchscripts/sqlbot/Required Modules/
Geography-Countries		"
Date::Simple			"

Without MySQL or these perl modules, you will not be able to run the bot! It's that
simple. There is no way around this, other than to re-write the whole script.

External Requirements
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
opendchub		I will not explain how to configure and run opendchub. There
			are enough README's and Forums to visit for info on it. It's
			not hard, I promise.

apache			Used to configure your bot. Without it you cannot easily
			configure the bot, unless you want to go manually via MySQL
			(not advised)

php-mysql		Required for php/apache to connect to the MySQL server. It should
			be included with your distro, so no extra compiling should be
			neccissary.

MySQL server		This speaks for itself. I will also not go into all the ins & outs
			of MySQL, because this would require about 5000 pages. Yes, it is
			comlex,	but once you have a basic setup, the rest should be easy.
			MySQL is included with your Linux distro (it always is, isn't it?!)

DBI::MySql		These Perl modules allow Perl to communicate with MySQL. Without it
			this script simply will not work. It has different file names,
			depending on which distro you use, but it is, as most of the other
			external requirements found in your distro.

IP::Country::Fast	Ok, here we have 2 required Perl modules which will have to be 
			downloaded and manually compiled & installed. There are included
			README files included with both sources. Just folow this and you
			should be fine.
			You can download the modules from:
				http://search.cpan.org/author/NWETTERS/IP-Country-2.11/
				http://search.cpan.org/author/ABIGAIL/Geography-Countries-1.4/
			NOTE: You have to install Geography-Countries first, as IP-Country
			requires it for installation (else you will get this warning).

Date::Simple		Lastly, sqlbot requires this small and simple data module for it's
			date format. You can download the module from:
				http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/J/JT/JTOBEY/





sqlbot Installation
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
OK, for arguments sake, I am going to assume you have your opendchub running smoothly
on your server. People can log in and out. Also, I am going to assume you have your
MySQL server running on the same computer (although it is possible to run it on
another). The last assumption I will make is that you do have access to the MySQL
server, and can log in and out with a user name & password, and have database read-write
permissions.

Then we are all set:

Install mysql tables:
	First thing to do is log in (manually, or via webmin) as your user (not root)
	and create a database called "odch". This will be the databse that sqlbot will
	use for all it's logging and configs. Right, installed?

	I have included a sqlbot_install.pl file. You have to edit this file to include
	the server, username and password. After you have edited it, run it as:

		`perl sqlbot_install.pl`

	it should hopefully install your required tables, and default data. If you get
	errors, look at the errors, as they probably will tell you what is wrong.
	





www & php Installation
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
You will to have a webserver server up and running. You must have php and php-mysql
installed and running. Test it with a simple <?phpinfo();?> in a blank php file
(like test.php). Make sure its running ok. Untar the php modules into an area on your
webserver,


edit dbinfo.inc.php:
	Edit the "dbinfo.inc.php" with the same username ,password and server just like
	you did with the installer script.


You might want to create access restrictions using .htaccess and .htpasswd (refer to
the apache documentation to find out how to do this).


Open the admin/index.php file in your browser (via your webserver, for instance
http://localhost/admin/index.php),  and configure !!




sqlbot Installation
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Ok, one thing to note here is that the main script (sqlbot.pl) IS your bot, but it 
needs to load the other modules. The script and the modules do NOT HAVE TO BE in the
same directory, and it is probably a better idea to keep them separate for future
updates. The sqlbot.pl should only need editing once, and in the future updates should
only require new/updated modules, and not sqlbot.pl. We did it this way to save you
editing the script each time.

The best way to set up the bot to run on your opendchub server is this way:

sqlbot.pl	move this file to your /home/<user>/.opendchub/scripts/ folder, open it
		up with a text editor, and edit it with the same username, password and
		server you used to install the MySQL tables with.
		Also, here you need to configure your bot's name, and other details
		required to configure your bot. And IMPORTANT thing to note here is the
		"$modules_path". The $modules_path is the full patch to the modules your
		bot requires to run. I would suggest using a folder like 

			/home/<user>/.opendchub/scripts/sqlbot/

		This would configured in your sqlbot.pl as:
			$modules_path = "/home/<user>/.opendchub/scripts/sqlbot/";
		(<user> being your username you are running the hub as)


<modules>.pm	All these modules should be coppied/moved to this directory you have
		just configured. They require no editing at all.






Run sqlbot
-=-=-=-=-=
That should about sum up all the configuring required to run the bot. Once all has been
done, you can finally load the bot into your opendchub by running "!reloadscripts" in
the main chat as your OP-Admin, and hopefully your new bot will run, and do exactly
what you asked of it.



Notes
-=-=-
Once your bot is running, configuring it should be easy. Just return to your www config
page and alter / adjust values... try it, try everything, just to get the hang of it :-)
The script does not need to be re-loaded for these changes, as they are read directly
from sql each time data gets parsed.

A great load of time and effort has been put into the creation of this sqlbot.
Nevertheless, it may (and probably does) contain bugs. This script is distributed as_is,
and you are welcome to change the code in whatever way. The only thing we ask is for you
to please contact us with bugs / bug_fixes, or just come and join us to chat about
features you may require in the bot / config. We are open to ideas :D
